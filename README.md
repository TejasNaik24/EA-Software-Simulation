# EA Software Simulation – C++ Certification Project

## Overview

This project was created as part of a **C++ software engineering certification**. It demonstrates core concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in C++, applied to a simulation-style system inspired by sports games.

The main feature proposed and implemented is a **Gym System** for a football-style simulation game, where players train attributes like Strength, Speed, Endurance, and Balance by completing mini-game challenges.

## My Feature

### Create A Gym For Physical Abilities

### Overview:
The abilities of college football are already incredible and are amazing for the players who help them in numerous tasks. Adding a gym where players can go and do certain challenges and work out at the gym is a better way to get and achieve these abilities and improve strength, endurance, speed, etc.
 
### Value Statement:
Adding such a gym will challenge the players  basic hard-working strength, endurance, and speed outside their game. By challenging their abilities of lifting, running long miles, and testing even small details like balance when running, and avoiding tackles. By completing these mini challenges in an environment of a gym environment, the players will earn experience points that will build their rating requirements to achieve the ability.
 
### Solution:
Players can enter the gym from the main menu to train four attributes: strength, endurance, speed, and balance, each with its own mini-game.
Strength features two challenges: a dumbbell test, where players mash buttons to lift weights quickly, and a barbell lift, which requires timed presses. Good timing earns points; mistakes reduce stamina.
Endurance is tested in a race against AI opponents. Players manage stamina by pacing button presses, dodging obstacles, and trso ying to finish first. Draining stamina causes a brief pause.
Speed challenges players to dodge incoming objects using a joystick. They have three lives, and the longer they last, the more speed points they earn.
Balance involves walking across a beam while wind machines try to knock the player off. Players use the joystick to stay balanced, earning more points the farther they go.
Points from each activity unlock special in-game abilities—for example, the "Arm Bar" requires a mix of strength, speed, and balance points.
 
### Evaluation Statement:
Adding this Gym will help players get their different category points for different abilities, vs them just getting the ability by some other factor. This will help test and ensure the player is receiving their skills in different sections outside of their gameplay. The addition of getting different point categories will ensure that getting the abilities will be possible for all of them. While this would take a long time to develop and build a functioning simulation of a gym for the game and challenges, I believe this addition would be incredible for the players to work on their pre-skills of strength, endurance, speed, and balance.
